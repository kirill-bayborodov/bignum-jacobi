[![C/ASM CI](https://github.com/kirill-bayborodov/bignum-jacobi/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kirill-bayborodov/bignum-jacobi/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/kirill-bayborodov/bignum-jacobi?label=release)](https://github.com/kirill-bayborodov/bignum-jacobi/releases/latest)

`bignum-jacobi` is a standalone C11/ASM module that computes the Jacobi symbol `(a/n)` for non-negative bounded `bignum_t` operands. The production path is an x86-64 YASM implementation conforming to the System V AMD64 ABI. The modulus must be positive and odd; inputs are borrowed and remain unchanged; the result is written only after successful validation.

The C11 implementation is the auditable reference path. The ASM implementation preserves the public status and output contract while providing an x86-64 performance implementation. Both paths support normalized operands up to `BIGNUM_CAPACITY` words.

## Distribution

The distribution contains the public header, compiled object/library artifacts, and the project-owned benchmark/test integration files. It does not expose internal scratch buffers or transfer ownership of caller inputs.

The required `bignum-core` component is included as a Git submodule at `libs/bignum-core`. Benchmark integration uses the pinned `benchmark-framework` distribution under `libs/benchmark-framework`.

| Component | Expected location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `bignum-core` | `libs/bignum-core` | Defines `bignum_t`, `BIGNUM_CAPACITY`, and common primitives |
| `benchmark-framework` | `libs/benchmark-framework` | Provides benchmark-core lifecycle, JSON matrix execution, and regression statistics |

Clone the repository with its submodule:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kirill-bayborodov/bignum-jacobi.git
cd bignum-jacobi
```

For an existing clone, initialize all submodules with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The Jacobi module has no runtime dependency on `bignum-add-u64` or `bignum-cmp`. If benchmark tools are used, initialize the pinned `benchmark-framework` submodule and its recursive dependencies before building.

## Features

- **Production ASM path:** x86-64 YASM implementation for the System V AMD64 ABI.
- **Explicit API status:** the public API exposes `bignum_jacobi_status_t` rather than reusing a generic core status type.
- **In-place logical shift:** complete-word and intra-word shifts are combined with carry propagation.
- **Overflow protection:** shifts that would discard significant bits return an explicit error.
- **Normalized representation:** successful operations update `len` and remove leading zero words.
- **Deterministic verification:** unit, boundary, extended, multithreaded, and integration-runner tests are included.
- **Reproducible benchmarks:** ST and MT runners accept deterministic seeds, report data fingerprints and checksums, and support legacy and parameterized workloads.
- **Pinned C11 benchmark framework:** `libs/benchmark-framework` is pinned to `v1.0.0`; its recursive gitlinks pin `benchmark-core` and `json-lib`.
- **Bignum domain adapter:** `benchmarks/adapter/` maps generic transport fields to bignum-specific `jacobi-*` and operand-length semantics without relabelling them as unrelated operations.
- **Template benchmark protocol:** successful runners print a machine-readable `benchmark=...` line immediately before `Benchmark finished.`.
- **Perf workflow:** Makefile targets provide sampling, repeated counter measurements, cloud-compatible software-event measurements, and report retention.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `make` | Build, test, lint, benchmark, and distribution targets |
| `gcc` | C compilation and linking |
| `yasm` | x86-64 assembly compilation |
| `cppcheck` | Static analysis |
| `perf` | Performance counters and sampling profiles |
| `taskset` | CPU-affinity control for benchmarks |
| `valgrind` | Helgrind race-detection target |
| `pthread` | Multithreaded tests and benchmarks |

The cloud benchmark target expects a `perf` binary compatible with the running kernel. In the current container workflow, this binary is configured by the `PERF` Makefile variable and is typically installed at `/usr/local/bin/perf`.

## API

The public API is declared in `include/bignum_jacobi.h`:

```c
typedef enum bignum_jacobi_status {
    BIGNUM_JACOBI_SUCCESS = 0,
    BIGNUM_JACOBI_ERROR_NULL_ARG = -1,
    BIGNUM_JACOBI_ERROR_MODULUS = -2
} bignum_jacobi_status_t;

bignum_jacobi_status_t bignum_jacobi(
    const bignum_t *a,
    const bignum_t *n,
    int *symbol);
```

### Contract

| Condition | Return value | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Any pointer is `NULL` | `BIGNUM_JACOBI_ERROR_NULL_ARG` | No input is dereferenced; output is unchanged |
| `n` is zero or even | `BIGNUM_JACOBI_ERROR_MODULUS` | Output is unchanged |
| Valid normalized `a` and positive odd `n` | `BIGNUM_JACOBI_SUCCESS` | Output receives exactly `-1`, `0`, or `1` |

Inputs are caller-owned borrowed values and are never modified. `symbol` is caller-allocated output storage and must not alias either input. Calls are thread-safe for independent immutable inputs and distinct outputs. The implementation uses no heap allocation; temporary state is stack-local.

For example:

```c
#include "bignum_jacobi.h"

int symbol = 0;
bignum_jacobi_status_t status = bignum_jacobi(&numerator, &odd_modulus, &symbol);
if (status != BIGNUM_JACOBI_SUCCESS) {
    /* Handle validation failure; symbol remains unchanged. */
}
```

## Build and test

Build the release object and source submodules:

```bash
make build CONFIG=release
```

The production object is generated at:

```text
build/bignum_jacobi.o
```

Run the deterministic, extended, multithreaded, and integration-runner suite:

```bash
make test CONFIG=release
```

The expected summary is:

```text
=== Summary: 0 / 5 failed ===
```

Run static analysis:

```bash
make lint
```

Run the sanitizer and race-detection targets:

```bash
make clean
make test_sanitize SAN=address CONFIG=debug

make clean
make test_sanitize SAN=undefined CONFIG=debug

make clean
make test_helgrind CONFIG=debug
```

The test files are organized as follows:

| File | Scope |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_bignum_jacobi.c` | Deterministic API, contract, and boundary tests |
| `tests/test_bignum_jacobi_extra.c` | Extended state, preservation, and boundary checks |
| `tests/test_bignum_jacobi_mt.c` | Concurrent independent-object checks |
| `tests/test_bignum_jacobi_runner.c` | Distribution integration smoke test |
| `tests/benchmark_adapter/test_bignum_jacobi_benchmark_adapter.c` | C11 transport mapping, validation, deterministic initialization, operation, and checksum tests |

## Benchmarks

The active benchmark sources are:

```text
benchmarks/bench_bignum_jacobi.c
benchmarks/bench_bignum_jacobi_mt.c
```

Each successful run reports the selected mode, seed, input fingerprint, checksum, successful-call count, elapsed time, and nanoseconds per call. Its final two lines follow this stable protocol:

```text
benchmark=bignum_jacobi_st ... elapsed_seconds=<seconds> ns_per_call=<nanoseconds>
Benchmark finished.
```

The MT runner uses `benchmark=bignum_jacobi_mt`. The trailing marker is the success condition checked by the Makefile; it must remain after the machine-readable line.

| Mode | Input pattern | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `all_zero` | Every input `bignum_t` is zero; Jacobi operand/modulus selection is zero | Measures the zero-value fast path |
| `all_nonzero` | Inputs are populated through `BIGNUM_CAPACITY` words with nonzero top words | Measures the normal nonzero shift path |
| `mixed` | Alternating zero and nonzero input rows | Measures a mixed workload and branch behavior |

### Single-thread CLI

```text
bin/bench_bignum_jacobi \
  [--data-mode all_zero|all_nonzero|mixed] \
  [--input-kind zero|nonzero|mixed] \
  [--operation-kind jacobi-zero|jacobi-bit|jacobi-word|jacobi-combined|jacobi-random|jacobi-mixed] \
  [--measure-mode end-to-end|kernel-only] \
  [--size-profile one|quarter|half|variable|near-capacity] \
  [--capacity-profile normal|near-capacity] \
  [--iterations N] [--warmup N] [--data-count N] [--seed N]
```

`--data-mode` preserves the three legacy scenarios. The independent `--input-kind`, `--operation-kind`, and `--size-profile` parameters select a custom profile and report `data_mode=custom`. `operation_kind` is a generic transport name, but the bignum adapter accepts only documented `jacobi-*` vocabulary and maps it to the actual bignum shift path.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `BENCH_ITERATIONS` | `2000000000` | Number of ST calls; must be positive |
| `BENCH_WARMUP` | `10000` | Calls completed before the timed ST interval |
| `BENCH_DATA_COUNT` | `4096` | Size of the pre-generated immutable data pool |
| `BENCH_SEED` | `0x9E3779B97F4A7C15` | Seed for deterministic pre-generated data |
| `BENCH_INPUT_KIND` | `nonzero` | `zero`, `nonzero`, or `mixed` input profile |
| `BENCH_OPERATION_KIND` | `jacobi-random` | `jacobi-zero`, `jacobi-bit`, `jacobi-word`, `jacobi-combined`, `jacobi-random`, or `jacobi-mixed` bignum operation transport value |
| `BENCH_MEASURE_MODE` | `end-to-end` | `end-to-end` includes per-call preparation; `kernel-only` excludes workspace restoration from the accumulated interval |
| `BENCH_SIZE_PROFILE` | `variable` | `one`, `quarter`, `half`, `variable`, or `near-capacity` bignum operand-length profile |
| `BENCH_CAPACITY_PROFILE` | `normal` | `normal` or `near-capacity`; the latter creates a valid boundary operand without intentionally measuring overflow handling |

CLI options override the corresponding environment variables. Example controlled ST comparison:

```bash
./bin/bench_bignum_jacobi \
  --input-kind nonzero --operation-kind jacobi-combined --size-profile half \
  --measure-mode end-to-end \
  --iterations 1000000 --warmup 10000 --data-count 4096 \
  --seed 123456789

./bin/bench_bignum_jacobi \
  --input-kind nonzero --operation-kind jacobi-combined --size-profile half \
  --measure-mode kernel-only \
  --iterations 1000000 --warmup 10000 --data-count 4096 \
  --seed 123456789
```

### Multithread CLI

```text
bin/bench_bignum_jacobi_mt \
  [--threads N] [--total-iterations N] \
  [--data-mode all_zero|all_nonzero|mixed] \
  [--input-kind zero|nonzero|mixed] \
  [--operation-kind jacobi-zero|jacobi-bit|jacobi-word|jacobi-combined|jacobi-random|jacobi-mixed] \
  [--measure-mode end-to-end|kernel-only] \
  [--size-profile one|quarter|half|variable|near-capacity] \
  [--capacity-profile normal|near-capacity] \
  [--warmup N] [--data-count N] [--seed N]
```

MT workers are created once, complete warm-up before the timed interval, then synchronize through barriers. `kernel-only` reports the longest per-worker accumulated operation interval, excluding the restoration copy before each batch; `end-to-end` reports wall-clock time from the synchronized release through all workers' completion.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `BENCH_MT_TOTAL_ITERATIONS` | `3200000000` | Total work across all threads; must be positive and divisible by the thread count |
| `BENCH_MT_THREADS` | `2` | Number of benchmark worker threads; must be positive |
| `BENCH_WARMUP` | `10000` | Warm-up calls per worker before the measured interval |
| `BENCH_DATA_COUNT` | `4096` | Size of the shared immutable data pool |
| `BENCH_SEED` | `0x9E3779B97F4A7C15` | Seed for deterministic pre-generated data |
| `BENCH_INPUT_KIND` | `nonzero` | `zero`, `nonzero`, or `mixed` input profile |
| `BENCH_OPERATION_KIND` | `jacobi-random` | `jacobi-zero`, `jacobi-bit`, `jacobi-word`, `jacobi-combined`, `jacobi-random`, or `jacobi-mixed` bignum operation transport value |
| `BENCH_MEASURE_MODE` | `end-to-end` | `end-to-end` or `kernel-only` measurement mode |
| `BENCH_SIZE_PROFILE` | `variable` | `one`, `quarter`, `half`, `variable`, or `near-capacity` bignum operand-length profile |
| `BENCH_CAPACITY_PROFILE` | `normal` | `normal` or `near-capacity` boundary profile |

For a fair one-thread/two-thread comparison, keep the total work and seed constant:

```bash
./bin/bench_bignum_jacobi_mt \
  --threads 1 \
  --total-iterations 3200000000 \
  --data-mode mixed

./bin/bench_bignum_jacobi_mt \
  --threads 2 \
  --total-iterations 3200000000 \
  --data-mode mixed
```

The reusable benchmark implementation is the public `libs/benchmark-framework` Git submodule pinned to `v1.0.0`. The project-local ST and MT sources call its `benchmark-core` lifecycle through `benchmarks/adapter/bignum_jacobi_benchmark_adapter.c`. The adapter validates bignum vocabulary, constructs deterministic `bignum_t` records, chooses valid odd moduli and representable Jacobi operands, and maps `bignum_jacobi_status_t` to the named framework callback status.

## Perf workflow

Use the cloud-compatible target when hardware PMU events are unavailable:

```bash
make bench_cl CONFIG=release \
  REPORT_NAME=baseline \
  PERF_RUNS=7
```

`bench_cl` uses `task-clock`, `context-switches`, `cpu-migrations`, and `page-faults`. It does not create raw `perf.data` profiles and requires the kernel-compatible binary configured by `PERF`.

On a host that supports the default hardware events, run the full ST/MT workflow for all three modes:

```bash
make bench_full CONFIG=release \
  REPORT_NAME=baseline \
  PERF_RUNS=7 \
  KEEP_PERF=1
```

For targeted repeated measurements:

```bash
make bench_stat_st CONFIG=release \
  REPORT_NAME=baseline_st_mixed \
  DATA_MODE=mixed \
  PERF_RUNS=7

make bench_stat_mt CONFIG=release \
  REPORT_NAME=baseline_mt_mixed \
  DATA_MODE=mixed \
  MT_THREADS=2 \
  MT_CPU_LIST=0-1 \
  MT_TOTAL_ITERATIONS=3200000000 \
  PERF_RUNS=7
```

Reports are written to `benchmarks/reports/`. With `KEEP_PERF=1`, record-mode raw profiles are retained as `.perf.data` files. Keep `CONFIG`, `PERF_RUNS`, `DATA_MODE`, seed, thread count, CPU affinity, and total iterations constant when comparing implementations.

### Parameterized JSON matrix and regression gate

`bench_matrix` invokes the pinned C11 `bench_matrix` and `benchmark_stats` tools directly, without Python or hardware PMU events. The default `benchmarks/profiles/bignum_jacobi_full.json` covers zero fast-paths, bit/word/combined Jacobi workloads, one/quarter/half/variable operand lengths, and safe near-capacity cases. `benchmarks/profiles/bignum_jacobi_standard.json` is the shorter bignum-specific smoke manifest and can be selected through `BENCH_MATRIX_PROFILE`. Each JSON manifest has a companion how-to document with its exact vocabulary and baseline workflow.

```bash
make bench_matrix CONFIG=release \
  REPORT_NAME=baseline \
  BENCH_MATRIX_REPETITIONS=7 \
  BENCH_MATRIX_ITERATIONS=200000000 \
  BENCH_MATRIX_MT_TOTAL_ITERATIONS=320000000 \
  MT_THREADS=2
```

The target writes `benchmarks/reports/baseline_matrix.json` and `benchmarks/reports/baseline_matrix_summary.json`. The raw artifact preserves host metadata, the manifest hash, commands, stdout/stderr, and parsed protocol values. The summary stores robust per-profile ST/MT statistics: median, mean, sample standard deviation, and MAD.

To compare a candidate with a reviewed baseline, pass the reference JSON explicitly. The target rejects absent/extra profile IDs and fails only when candidate median `ns_per_call` is both above the configured percentage threshold and above the baseline MAD noise floor.

```bash
make bench_matrix CONFIG=release \
  REPORT_NAME=candidate \
  BENCH_BASELINE=benchmarks/reports/baseline_matrix.json \
  BENCH_REGRESSION_THRESHOLD_PCT=5
```

Do not replace a baseline automatically. Create it from a reviewed reproducible run with stable host topology, CPU affinity, compiler version, workload settings, and source revision.

For a short cloud smoke test, combine the documented environment variables with the Makefile target:

```bash
BENCH_ITERATIONS=100000 \
BENCH_MT_TOTAL_ITERATIONS=100000 \
BENCH_SEED=123456789 \
make bench_cl CONFIG=release REPORT_NAME=smoke PERF_RUNS=1 \
  MT_TOTAL_ITERATIONS=100000
```

## Installation and distribution

Build the object-file distribution:

```bash
make install CONFIG=release
```

Build the single-header and static-library distribution:

```bash
make dist CONFIG=release
```

Remove generated artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

## Linking the object file

For development builds, first compile the module and its source dependencies:

```bash
make build CONFIG=release
```

Then link your application with the component object and the required include paths:

```bash
gcc your_app.c \
  build/bignum_jacobi.o \
  -I./include \
  -I./libs/bignum-core/include \
  -o your_app \
  -no-pie
```

If the application requires symbols from the Jacobi dependency graph, prefer the distribution created by `make dist CONFIG=release` and link the resulting static library with the corresponding component libraries.

## Contributing

Contributions should preserve the public C/ASM contract, update deterministic and multithreaded tests when behavior changes, and run at least:

```bash
make test CONFIG=release
make lint
```

Performance changes should include reproducible benchmark parameters, matching ST/MT evidence, and a comparison that uses the same mode, seed, total work, thread count, CPU affinity, and counter configuration.
